# Good Fish
## A sustainable seafood marketplace

We were inspired by the problem of unsold bycatch becoming food waste. We chose to tackle this
challenge to increase:
- Food security,
- Fisher incomes,
- Buyer access to fresh, local fish, and
- Sustainability.

We also wanted to our solution to have an intuitive user experience

Challenge theme(s) covered: `Extra Harvest Marketplace`, `Catch Area Tokenization`, and `High-value
Seafood Passport Token`
